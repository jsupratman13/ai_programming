Notes for GOAP

#Goal Oriented Action Planning or goap is an artificial intelligence system for agents that allows them to plan a sequence of actions to satisfy a particular goal.Sequence of action depends not only on the goal but also on the current sate of the world and agent

##Goap is composed of two things
##1.Finite State Machine
##2.A-star search

##Finiite State Machine or FSM is amodel of compuation based on hypothetical machine made of one or more state. Only a single state can be activeaat the same time, so the machine must transition from one state to another in order to perform different action
##can be represented by graph where the NODES are the STATES ande the EDGES are TRANSITIONS
