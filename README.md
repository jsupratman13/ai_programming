#Game AI Architecture Examples UNDERCONSTRUCTION
Collection of behavior selection AI written in Python2.7. Note that programs here are not the only way to write the code. Programs here only demonstrates the basic concept and intended to be used to understand the flow of the AI architecture.

##Current Types of AI
* Finite State Machine (FSM)
* Behavior Tree (BT)
* Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)
* Hierarchial Task Network Planner (HTN Planner)

##Planned
[ ] Rule Based
[ ] Hierarchal Finite State Machine (HFSM)
[ ] Utility System
